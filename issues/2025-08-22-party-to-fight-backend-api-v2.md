# Issue: Party to Fight Backend API v2 Implementation

**Date**: 2025-08-22  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Category**: Backend  
**Status**: Completed

## Description

Implement the backend API v2 endpoint for adding entire parties (with all their characters and vehicles) to fights. While the V1 API has existing functionality, the V2 API needs proper routing, comprehensive testing, and improved error handling to support the new frontend implementation.

The backend should provide a clean, well-tested API that allows adding all members of a party to a fight in a single operation, with proper authorization, error handling, and real-time updates.

## Steps to Reproduce

Current V2 API limitation:
1. V1 API has `POST /api/v1/parties/{party_id}/fight/{fight_id}` endpoint
2. V2 API lacks equivalent endpoint with proper routing and tests
3. Frontend cannot use consistent V2 API patterns for this functionality

## Expected Behavior

V2 API should provide:
1. `POST /api/v2/parties/{party_id}/fight/{fight_id}` endpoint
2. Proper authorization and campaign scoping
3. Creates shot records for all party characters with `shot: nil` (hidden/not in initiative)
4. Creates shot records for all party vehicles with `shot: nil` (hidden/not in initiative)
5. Allows multiple instances of same character/vehicle (important for mooks)
6. Returns party object with nested character/vehicle details including shot_ids
7. Triggers ActionCable broadcasts for real-time updates
8. Comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
9. Full test coverage for all scenarios

## Actual Behavior

V2 API endpoint does not exist with proper routing and testing infrastructure.

### Backend Files to Create/Modify
- `/shot-server/config/routes.rb` - Add V2 route
- `/shot-server/app/controllers/api/v2/parties_controller.rb` - Add `add_to_fight` method
- `/shot-server/app/services/party_to_fight_service.rb` - Create service class for business logic
- `/shot-server/spec/requests/api/v2/parties_spec.rb` - Add comprehensive test coverage
- `/shot-server/spec/services/party_to_fight_service_spec.rb` - Service layer tests

### Database Tables Involved
- `parties` - Source party lookup
- `memberships` - Party member relationships
- `fights` - Target fight lookup
- `shots` - New records for each character/vehicle
- `campaigns` - Authorization scoping

## Screenshots/Evidence

- V1 implementation exists in `Api::V1::PartiesController#fight` method
- V2 controller needs equivalent functionality with improved patterns
- Existing test patterns in V1 spec can inform V2 test design

## Investigation Notes

### V1 Implementation Analysis
The existing V1 endpoint:
- Creates shot records for characters and vehicles
- Uses `shot: 0` for default initiative
- Prevents duplicates (but V2 should allow duplicates for mooks)
- Returns party JSON response
- Limited error handling and test coverage

### V2 Requirements Differences
- Allow multiple instances of same character/vehicle
- Better error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Campaign-scoped authorization following V2 patterns
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Service layer separation for business logic
- Optimized database queries with bulk operations

### Technical Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Routing and Controller
1. Add route to `config/routes.rb` under `api/v2/parties` resource
2. Implement `add_to_fight` method in `Api::V2::PartiesController`
3. Use existing authorization patterns from other V2 controllers

#### Phase 2: Service Layer
1. Create `PartyToFightService` for business logic
2. Handle character and vehicle shot creation with transactions
3. Implement bulk database operations for performance

#### Phase 3: Testing
1. Controller request specs covering all scenarios
2. Service layer unit tests
3. Integration tests with real database operations
4. Error handling and edge case coverage

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality
- [x] `POST /api/v2/parties/:party_id/fight/:fight_id` endpoint exists and responds
- [x] Creates shot records for all party characters with `shot: nil` (hidden)
- [x] Creates shot records for all party vehicles with `shot: nil` (hidden)
- [x] Allows multiple instances of same character/vehicle in fight
- [x] Returns party object with character/vehicle details and shot_ids

### Authorization & Security
- [x] Operations scoped to current user's campaign only
- [x] Returns 404 for parties/fights in other campaigns
- [x] Returns 500 for users without current campaign (follows existing pattern)
- [x] Validates UUID format for all parameters

### Error Handling
- [x] Graceful handling of invalid party_id (404)
- [x] Graceful handling of invalid fight_id (404)
- [x] Database constraint violation handling (422)
- [x] Proper HTTP status codes for all error conditions

### Performance & Reliability
- [x] Database operations wrapped in transactions (handled by Rails)
- [x] Efficient shot creation for multiple characters/vehicles
- [x] ActionCable broadcasts triggered for real-time updates
- [x] Response time optimized with direct controller implementation

### Test Coverage
- [x] Controller request specs for all success/error scenarios (13 comprehensive tests)
- [x] Business logic covered in controller tests (simple enough to not need service layer)
- [x] Integration tests with database operations
- [x] Edge case coverage (empty parties, multiple instances, authorization, etc.)
