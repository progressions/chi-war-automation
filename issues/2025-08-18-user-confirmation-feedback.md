# User Confirmation Feedback Issue

**Date**: 2025-08-18
**Priority**: Medium
**Type**: UX Improvement

## Issue Description

When users try to log in with an unconfirmed account, they are not given clear feedback about why the login is failing. The application silently fails or shows generic error messages instead of informing the user that they need to confirm their email address.

## Current Behavior

- User creates account
- User receives confirmation email but doesn't click it
- User tries to log in
- Login fails silently or with generic error
- User is confused and doesn't know they need to confirm their email

## Expected Behavior

- User tries to log in with unconfirmed account
- Application shows clear message: "Please check your email and confirm your account before logging in"
- Optional: Provide "Resend confirmation email" button
- Clear guidance on what the user needs to do

## Technical Details

- Using Devise with confirmable module
- Frontend should check for confirmation-related errors from backend
- Backend should return appropriate error messages for unconfirmed accounts

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Clear error message when login fails due to unconfirmed account
- [ ] Message explains that email confirmation is required
- [ ] Optional: Add resend confirmation email functionality
- [ ] Error message is user-friendly and actionable

## Impact

- Improves user onboarding experience
- Reduces confusion for new users
- Reduces support requests about login issues
