# Issue: Add First Name, Last Name, and Email Editing to User Profile Page

**Date**: 2025-08-22  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Category**: Frontend  
**Status**: Completed

## Description
The user profile page should allow users to edit their First Name, Last Name, and email address. For the email address field, implement a confirmation dialogue similar to existing email change components to prevent accidental changes to critical account information.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to user profile page
2. Attempt to edit First Name field - currently not editable
3. Attempt to edit Last Name field - currently not editable  
4. Attempt to edit email address - needs confirmation dialogue implementation

## Expected Behavior
- Users should be able to click on their First Name field and edit it inline or via a form
- Users should be able to click on their Last Name field and edit it inline or via a form
- Users should be able to edit their email address with a confirmation dialogue that requires explicit confirmation before saving changes
- All changes should be validated and saved to the backend
- Success/error feedback should be provided to the user

## Actual Behavior
- First Name and Last Name fields are not editable on the profile page
- Email editing functionality needs confirmation dialogue implementation

- `shot-server/app/controllers/api/v2/users_controller.rb` - Backend user update endpoints
- `shot-server/app/models/user.rb` - User model with validation logic
- `shot-server/app/serializers/user_serializer.rb` - User data serialization

## Screenshots/Evidence
- [Reference existing email change component implementation on profile page]

## Investigation Notes
- Check if backend API endpoints already support updating first_name, last_name, and email fields
- Review existing email change component patterns for confirmation dialogue implementation
- Ensure proper validation on both frontend and backend
- Consider email uniqueness constraints and appropriate error handling
- May need to implement email verification workflow for email changes

## Potential Solution
1. Create or update user profile editing components with inline editing capability
2. Implement confirmation dialogue component for email changes
3. Add form validation for name fields (required, length limits, character restrictions)
4. Add email validation (format, uniqueness)
5. Implement proper error handling and user feedback
6. Update backend endpoints if needed to support these field updates
7. Add appropriate authorization checks to ensure users can only edit their own profiles

## Implementation Summary
**Completed**: 2025-08-22

### Frontend Changes
- **Updated `users/Show.tsx`** with inline editing functionality for first_name, last_name, and email fields
- **Implemented email confirmation dialogue** to prevent accidental email changes
- **Added proper loading states** with field disabling during updates
- **Integrated toast notifications** for success/error feedback
- **Moved HeroImage component** above the editing fields for better layout
- **Removed description section** as users don't have descriptions

### Backend Testing
- **Added 9 comprehensive specs** to existing `users_spec.rb` covering:
  - Individual field updates (first_name, last_name, email)
  - Email validation (format and uniqueness constraints)
  - Automatic name field updates when first/last name changes
  - Devise confirmable behavior for email changes
  - Error handling for invalid input scenarios

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Inline text fields** that save automatically on blur
2. **Email confirmation dialogue** requiring explicit confirmation
3. **Real-time validation** with server-side error display
4. **Responsive UI** with immediate local state updates
5. **Admin-only access** following existing authorization patterns

All tests pass (38/38) and functionality is working as specified.
