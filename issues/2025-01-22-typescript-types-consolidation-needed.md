# Issue: TypeScript Types Consolidation and Organization

**Date**: 2025-01-22  
**Priority**: High  
**Category**: Frontend  
**Status**: Closed

## Description
Comprehensive analysis of the shot-client-next TypeScript types reveals significant duplication, scattered type definitions, and organizational issues. The `FormStateData` interface is duplicated across 12+ Table components, component prop types are scattered throughout the codebase instead of centralized, and reducer/utility types are defined outside the types folder.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to any Table component (e.g., `src/components/weapons/Table.tsx`)
2. Observe the `FormStateData` interface definition at the top
3. Compare with other Table components - identical interfaces redefined
4. Search for `*Properties` and `*Props` types across components
5. Check `src/reducers/` for types that should be in `src/types/`

## Expected Behavior
- All shared types should be centralized in `src/types/` directory
- No duplicate type definitions across components
- Consistent naming conventions for component props
- Clear organization with focused type files by category

## Actual Behavior
- `FormStateData` interface duplicated in 12+ Table components
- 50+ component prop types defined inline instead of centralized
- Reducer types scattered in `src/reducers/` instead of `src/types/`
- Inconsistent mix of `*Properties` and `*Props` naming conventions

## Related Files
### Files with FormStateData duplication:
- `src/components/weapons/Table.tsx:8-15`
- `src/components/schticks/Table.tsx:8-15`
- `src/components/sites/Table.tsx:13-20`
- `src/components/junctures/Table.tsx:8-15`
- `src/components/vehicles/Table.tsx:9-16`
- `src/components/factions/Table.tsx:8-15`
- `src/components/parties/Table.tsx:13-20`
- `src/components/campaigns/Table.tsx:12-19`
- `src/components/characters/Table.tsx:15-22`
- `src/components/fights/Table.tsx:8-15`
- `src/components/users/Table.tsx:8-15`

### Files with misplaced types:
- `src/reducers/formState.ts:78-101` (should move to types)
- `src/reducers/userState.ts:11-28` (should move to types)
- `src/lib/filterConfigs.ts:1-14` (should move to types)
- `src/lib/paginateArray.ts:3-7` (should move to types)

### Current types organization:
- `src/types/index.ts` (main exports)
- `src/types/types.ts` (378 lines - too large, needs splitting)
- `src/types/character.ts` (well-organized)
- `src/types/resources.ts` (core entities)
- `src/types/responses.ts` (API responses)
- `src/types/defaults.ts` (default values)
- `src/types/encounters.ts` (small, focused)

## Screenshots/Evidence
Code analysis report generated by code-searcher agent showing:
- 12+ identical FormStateData interfaces
- 50+ scattered component prop types
- Inconsistent naming patterns

## Investigation Notes
The types folder structure exists but is incomplete. Many types that should be centralized are scattered throughout component files and service files. This creates maintenance overhead and potential inconsistencies. The current `src/types/types.ts` file is too large (378 lines) and contains mixed utility and domain-specific types that should be separated.

## Potential Solution
### Phase 1: Create focused type files
- `src/types/forms.ts` - Form and table state types
- `src/types/props.ts` - Component prop types  
- `src/types/state.ts` - Reducer and context state types
- `src/types/utilities.ts` - Utility types

### Phase 2: Consolidate FormStateData
- Create unified `TableFormStateData<T>` in `src/types/forms.ts`
- Update all 12 Table components to import centralized type
- Remove duplicate interface definitions

### Phase 3: Move misplaced types
- Move reducer types from `src/reducers/` to `src/types/state.ts`
- Move utility types from `src/lib/` to `src/types/utilities.ts`
- Update import statements across affected files

### Phase 4: Standardize naming
- Convert all `*Properties` to `*Props` consistently
- Group related prop types in dedicated files

### Phase 5: Split large type files
- Break down `src/types/types.ts` into focused categories
- Maintain backward compatibility through re-exports in `src/types/index.ts`
