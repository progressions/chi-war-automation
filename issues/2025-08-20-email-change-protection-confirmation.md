# Issue: Protect User Profile Email Changes with Confirmation Dialog

**Date**: 2025-08-20  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Category**: Frontend/Security  
**Status**: Completed

## Description

The user profile page currently allows email address changes without proper confirmation, which poses a security risk. Changing an email address is a significant account modification that could impact authentication, password recovery, and account security. The application needs to implement a confirmation dialog before allowing users to change their email address to prevent accidental changes and ensure user intent.

Email changes should require explicit user confirmation through a dialog that warns about the implications of the change and requires the user to actively confirm their decision before proceeding with the update.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing User Profile Functionality
- User profile page allows direct email editing
- Email changes are submitted without confirmation
- No warning about the security implications of email changes
- Immediate API update upon form submission

### Security Concerns
- Accidental email changes could lock users out of their accounts
- No confirmation step to verify user intent
- Email changes affect authentication and password recovery
- No opportunity for users to reconsider the change

## Steps to Reproduce Current Behavior

1. Navigate to user profile page (when implemented)
2. Edit the email address field
3. Submit the form
4. Email is changed immediately without confirmation
5. No warning or confirmation dialog appears

## Expected Behavior

### Email Change Protection Flow
1. **Initial Edit**: User can edit email field normally
2. **Submit Attempt**: When form is submitted with changed email, show confirmation dialog
3. **Confirmation Dialog**: Display warning about email change implications
4. **User Decision**: 
   - **Confirm**: Proceed with email change and API update
   - **Cancel**: Revert email field to original value, no API call

### Confirmation Dialog Requirements
1. **Clear Warning**: Explain that changing email affects login and account recovery
2. **Current vs New**: Show both current and new email addresses
3. **Security Notice**: Warn about potential account access issues
4. **Action Buttons**: Clear "Confirm Change" and "Cancel" options
5. **Focus Management**: Proper focus handling for accessibility

**Frontend UI Components (Need Creation):**
- Email change confirmation dialog component
- Reusable confirmation dialog for sensitive operations

**Frontend API Client:**
- `shot-client-next/src/lib/client/userClient.ts` - User update API calls
- `shot-client-next/src/types/resources.ts` - User type definitions

**Backend API:**
- `shot-server/app/controllers/api/v2/users_controller.rb` - User update endpoint
- `shot-server/app/models/user.rb` - User model with email validation

## Technical Analysis

### Current Form Flow
1. User edits profile form including email field
2. Form submission triggers immediate API call
3. Success/error feedback displayed
4. No intermediate confirmation step

### Proposed Protected Flow
1. User edits profile form including email field
2. Form validation detects email change
3. Confirmation dialog appears before API call
4. User confirms or cancels the change
5. API call only proceeds after explicit confirmation

### Email Change Detection
```typescript
interface EmailChangeDetection {
  originalEmail: string
  currentEmail: string
  hasEmailChanged: boolean
  requiresConfirmation: boolean
}
```

## Proposed Solution

### Phase 1: Email Change Detection

**1. Form State Management**
- Track original email value when form loads
- Detect changes during form editing
- Flag email changes for confirmation requirement

**2. Submission Interception**
- Intercept form submission when email has changed
- Show confirmation dialog instead of immediate API call
- Allow normal submission for non-email changes

### Phase 2: Confirmation Dialog Implementation

**1. Dialog Component**
- Create reusable confirmation dialog for email changes
- Display current and new email addresses
- Include security warnings and implications
- Provide clear confirm/cancel actions

**2. User Experience**
- Modal dialog with backdrop
- Accessible keyboard navigation
- Clear visual hierarchy and messaging
- Proper focus management

### Phase 3: Integration and Testing

**1. Form Integration**
- Integrate confirmation dialog with user profile form
- Handle confirmation and cancellation flows
- Maintain form state throughout the process

**2. Error Handling**
- Handle API errors after confirmation
- Provide feedback for successful changes
- Manage loading states during confirmation flow

## Implementation Details

### Email Change Detection Logic
```typescript
interface UserProfileFormState {
  originalEmail: string
  formData: UserFormData
  emailChanged: boolean
  showEmailConfirmation: boolean
}

const detectEmailChange = (original: string, current: string): boolean => {
  return original.toLowerCase().trim() !== current.toLowerCase().trim()
}

const handleFormSubmit = async (formData: UserFormData) => {
  const emailChanged = detectEmailChange(originalEmail, formData.email)
  
  if (emailChanged) {
    setShowEmailConfirmation(true)
    return // Don't submit yet
  }
  
  // Normal submission for non-email changes
  await submitUserUpdate(formData)
}
```

### Confirmation Dialog Component
```typescript
interface EmailChangeConfirmationProps {
  open: boolean
  currentEmail: string
  newEmail: string
  onConfirm: () => void
  onCancel: () => void
}

function EmailChangeConfirmation({
  open,
  currentEmail,
  newEmail,
  onConfirm,
  onCancel
}: EmailChangeConfirmationProps) {
  return (
    <Dialog open={open} onClose={onCancel}>
      <DialogTitle>Confirm Email Address Change</DialogTitle>
      <DialogContent>
        <Alert severity="warning" sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
          Changing your email address will affect your login credentials and account recovery options.
        </Alert>
        
        <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
          Are you sure you want to change your email address?
        </Typography>
        
        <Box sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
          <Typography variant="body2" color="text.secondary">
            Current email: <strong>{currentEmail}</strong>
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body2" color="text.secondary">
            New email: <strong>{newEmail}</strong>
          </Typography>
        </Box>
        
        <Typography variant="body2" color="text.secondary" sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
          You will need to use the new email address for future logins.
        </Typography>
      </DialogContent>
      <DialogActions>
        <Button onClick={onCancel}>Cancel</Button>
        <Button onClick={onConfirm} variant="contained" color="warning">
          Confirm Change
        </Button>
      </DialogActions>
    </Dialog>
  )
}
```

### Form Integration
```typescript
const UserProfileForm = ({ user }: { user: User }) => {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState(user)
  const [originalEmail] = useState(user.email)
  const [showEmailConfirmation, setShowEmailConfirmation] = useState(false)
  
  const handleSubmit = async (e: FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    
    const emailChanged = detectEmailChange(originalEmail, formData.email)
    
    if (emailChanged) {
      setShowEmailConfirmation(true)
      return
    }
    
    await updateUser(formData)
  }
  
  const handleEmailChangeConfirm = async () => {
    setShowEmailConfirmation(false)
    await updateUser(formData)
  }
  
  const handleEmailChangeCancel = () => {
    setShowEmailConfirmation(false)
    setFormData({ ...formData, email: originalEmail }) // Revert to original
  }
  
  return (
    <>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        {/* Form fields */}
      </form>
      
      <EmailChangeConfirmation
        open={showEmailConfirmation}
        currentEmail={originalEmail}
        newEmail={formData.email}
        onConfirm={handleEmailChangeConfirm}
        onCancel={handleEmailChangeCancel}
      />
    </>
  )
}
```
