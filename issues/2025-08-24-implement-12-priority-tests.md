# Implement 12 Priority Tests for Legacy Client

**Date**: 2025-08-24
**Priority**: High
**Category**: Testing
**Status**: Completed

## Description

Implement 12 high-priority tests based on the comprehensive testing gap investigation completed on 2025-01-27. Focus on critical areas with zero coverage that pose the highest business risk.

## Background

The investigation identified:
- 50+ high-priority functions/components needing tests
- Zero coverage for authentication, real-time features, and API layer
- Critical business risks from untested code
- Current: 1948 tests (up from 344 at investigation time)

## Selected 12 Tests to Implement

Based on risk assessment and business impact, implementing tests for:

### Phase 1: Critical Authentication & State (4 tests)
1. **LocalStorageContext** - Persistent state management
2. **ToastContext** - User notification system
3. **Api.ts utility** - Core API URL builder and configuration
4. **Client.ts error handling** - Network error recovery

### Phase 2: Component Integration (4 tests)
5. **RollInitiative component** - Critical combat flow
6. **CharacterFilters component** - Character list filtering
7. **ActionModal component** - Character action execution
8. **CreateCharacter component** - Character creation flow

### Phase 3: Services & Utilities (4 tests)
9. **FightEventService** - Combat event logging
10. **WeaponService** - Weapon damage calculations
11. **PartyService edge cases** - Party member management
12. **DiceService edge cases** - Extreme dice explosion scenarios

## Implementation Strategy

### Test Structure
- Unit tests for services and utilities
- Integration tests for components with mocked dependencies
- Edge case tests for boundary conditions
- Error scenario tests for network/state failures

### Mock Requirements
- LocalStorage mock for persistent state tests
- Network request mocks for API tests
- Context provider mocks for component tests
- Timer mocks for async operations

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All 12 test files created and passing
- [x] Minimum 5 test cases per test file
- [x] Edge cases and error scenarios covered
- [x] Mocks properly configured and reusable
- [x] Tests follow existing patterns and conventions
- [x] No regression in existing test suite
- [x] Documentation updated with new test patterns

## Technical Details

### File Locations
- Context tests: `__tests__/contexts/`
- Component tests: `__tests__/components/`
- Service tests: `__tests__/services/`
- Utility tests: `__tests__/utils/`

### Testing Patterns
- Use React Testing Library for components
- Use Jest mocks for external dependencies
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Use factory functions from MockFactories.ts

## Expected Impact

- Reduce critical business risks
- Improve code reliability by 15-20%
- Provide safety net for future refactoring
- Document expected behavior through tests
- Enable confident deployment of changes
