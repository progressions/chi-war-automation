# Investigate Additional Testing Opportunities and Edge Cases

**Date**: 2025-01-27
**Priority**: Medium
**Category**: Testing

## Description

Conduct a comprehensive code analysis to identify areas that would benefit from additional Jest unit testing, with focus on:
1. Components, hooks, and utilities not currently tested
2. Edge cases missing from existing test suites
3. Complex business logic that lacks sufficient coverage
4. Error handling paths and boundary conditions

## Current Testing State

**Current test coverage: 344 tests across:**
- CharacterService (11 tests)
- VehicleService (85 tests) 
- SharedService (85 tests)
- DiceService (17 tests)
- paginateArray (22 tests)
- errorHandler (19 tests)
- Utility functions (52 tests: parseToNumber, queryParams, filterConfigs)
- userState reducer (24 tests)
- FormState reducer, useEntity hook, Autocomplete component (existing)
- EmailChangeConfirmation, ProfilePageClient (existing)

## Investigation Areas

### 1. React Components Requiring Tests

**Priority: High**
- Complex form components with validation logic
- Autocomplete components with async data fetching
- Modal and dialog components with state management
- List/table components with sorting and filtering
- Navigation components with route handling

### 2. Custom React Hooks

**Priority: High**
- Data fetching hooks with error handling
- State management hooks with complex logic
- Event listener hooks
- Local storage hooks
- WebSocket connection hooks

### 3. API Client Layer

**Priority: High**
- Individual client modules (characterClient.ts, campaignClient.ts, etc.)
- Request/response transformation logic
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Authentication token management
- WebSocket client functionality

### 4. Context Providers

**Priority: Medium**
- AppContext state management and side effects
- EncounterContext real-time updates
- ToastContext notification system
- Authentication context flows

### 5. Service Layer Gaps

**Priority: Medium**
- Additional service classes not yet tested
- Complex calculation methods
- Data transformation utilities
- Business rule validation

### 6. Edge Cases in Existing Tests

**Priority: Medium**

#### CharacterService Edge Cases
- Negative wound values and overflow scenarios
- Division by zero in impairment calculations
- Invalid character type transitions
- Concurrent state modifications

#### DiceService Edge Cases
- Extreme explosion scenarios (1000+ consecutive 6s)
- Performance with very large dice pools
- Floating point precision in calculations
- Invalid input sanitization

#### VehicleService Edge Cases
- Vehicle-to-character conversion edge cases
- Driver/passenger relationship validation
- Speed calculation boundary conditions

#### Utility Function Edge Cases
- parseToNumber with very large numbers, scientific notation
- queryParams with deeply nested objects, circular references
- filterConfigs with malformed configuration data

### 7. Error Handling Gaps

**Priority: Medium**
- Network timeout scenarios
- Malformed API response handling
- Authentication token expiration flows
- WebSocket connection failures
- Browser storage quota exceeded

### 8. Performance and Memory

**Priority: Low**
- Large dataset processing
- Memory leak detection in long-running operations
- Cleanup in useEffect hooks
- Event listener disposal

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Code Analysis
- Use code-searcher agent to systematically examine untested files
- Identify complex functions with high cyclomatic complexity
- Map dependencies and interaction patterns
- Document current test coverage gaps

### Phase 2: Edge Case Identification
- Review existing tests for missing boundary conditions
- Analyze error handling paths
- Identify assumption-based code that needs validation
- Document potential race conditions and timing issues

### Phase 3: Risk Assessment
- Prioritize testing based on business criticality
- Consider user-facing impact of uncovered code
- Evaluate regression risk for untested functionality
- Balance testing effort vs. risk mitigation

### Phase 4: Implementation Planning
- Create targeted test implementation plan
- Estimate effort for each testing area
- Define acceptance criteria for coverage improvements
- Plan incremental implementation strategy

## Expected Deliverables

### Investigation Report
- Comprehensive analysis of testing gaps
- Prioritized list of components/functions needing tests
- Edge case documentation for existing test suites
- Risk assessment matrix for untested code

### Implementation Recommendations
- Specific test scenarios to implement
- Mock/fixture requirements for complex tests
- Integration testing opportunities
- Performance testing strategies

### Coverage Improvement Plan
- Target test count increases by category
- Timeline for incremental implementation
- Resource requirements and effort estimates
- Success metrics and completion criteria

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Complete code analysis covering all major application areas
- [ ] Documented list of 20+ specific components/functions requiring tests
- [ ] Identification of 15+ edge cases missing from existing test suites
- [ ] Risk-prioritized implementation plan with effort estimates
- [ ] Specific test scenarios defined for highest-priority items
- [ ] Mock/testing infrastructure requirements documented
- [ ] Integration with existing Jest setup validated

## Expected Benefits

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Systematic identification of testing gaps
- **Risk Mitigation**: Prioritized testing based on business impact
- **Code Quality**: Improved reliability through edge case validation
- **Development Confidence**: Safer refactoring and feature development
- **Documentation**: Tests as executable specifications for complex logic
- **Regression Prevention**: Early detection of breaking changes

## Implementation Priority

Medium - This investigation will guide future testing efforts and ensure comprehensive coverage of critical application functionality. While not immediately user-facing, it provides foundation for robust application reliability.

## Estimated Effort

**Investigation Phase**: 2-3 days of systematic code analysis
**Documentation**: 1 day for comprehensive reporting
**Planning**: 1 day for prioritization and implementation strategy

**Expected Output**: 50-100 additional test scenarios identified, with clear implementation roadmap for expanding from 344 to 450+ total tests.
