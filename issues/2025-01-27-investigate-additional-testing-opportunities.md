# Investigate Additional Testing Opportunities and Edge Cases

**Date**: 2025-01-27
**Priority**: Medium
**Category**: Testing

## Description

Conduct a comprehensive code analysis to identify areas that would benefit from additional Jest unit testing, with focus on:
1. Components, hooks, and utilities not currently tested
2. Edge cases missing from existing test suites
3. Complex business logic that lacks sufficient coverage
4. Error handling paths and boundary conditions

## Current Testing State

**Current test coverage: 344 tests across:**
- CharacterService (11 tests)
- VehicleService (85 tests) 
- SharedService (85 tests)
- DiceService (17 tests)
- paginateArray (22 tests)
- errorHandler (19 tests)
- Utility functions (52 tests: parseToNumber, queryParams, filterConfigs)
- userState reducer (24 tests)
- FormState reducer, useEntity hook, Autocomplete component (existing)
- EmailChangeConfirmation, ProfilePageClient (existing)

- Floating point precision in calculations
- Invalid input sanitization

#### VehicleService Edge Cases
- Vehicle-to-character conversion edge cases
- Driver/passenger relationship validation
- Speed calculation boundary conditions

#### Utility Function Edge Cases
- parseToNumber with very large numbers, scientific notation
- queryParams with deeply nested objects, circular references
- filterConfigs with malformed configuration data

### 7. Error Handling Gaps

**Priority: Medium**
- Network timeout scenarios
- Malformed API response handling
- Authentication token expiration flows
- WebSocket connection failures
- Browser storage quota exceeded

### 8. Performance and Memory

**Priority: Low**
- Large dataset processing
- Memory leak detection in long-running operations
- Cleanup in useEffect hooks
- Event listener disposal

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Code Analysis
- Use code-searcher agent to systematically examine untested files
- Identify complex functions with high cyclomatic complexity
- Map dependencies and interaction patterns
- Document current test coverage gaps

### Phase 2: Edge Case Identification
- Review existing tests for missing boundary conditions
- Analyze error handling paths
- Identify assumption-based code that needs validation
- Document potential race conditions and timing issues

### Phase 3: Risk Assessment
- Prioritize testing based on business criticality
- Consider user-facing impact of uncovered code
- Evaluate regression risk for untested functionality
- Balance testing effort vs. risk mitigation

### Phase 4: Implementation Planning
- Create targeted test implementation plan
- Estimate effort for each testing area
- Define acceptance criteria for coverage improvements
- Plan incremental implementation strategy

## Expected Deliverables

### Investigation Report
- Comprehensive analysis of testing gaps
- Prioritized list of components/functions needing tests
- Edge case documentation for existing test suites
- Risk assessment matrix for untested code

### Implementation Recommendations
- Specific test scenarios to implement
- Mock/fixture requirements for complex tests
- Integration testing opportunities
- Performance testing strategies

### Coverage Improvement Plan
- Target test count increases by category
- Timeline for incremental implementation
- Resource requirements and effort estimates
- Success metrics and completion criteria

## COMPLETED ✅

**Investigation completed on 2025-01-27**

### Investigation Results:

**Comprehensive Code Analysis Completed:**
- ✅ **React Components Analysis**: Code-searcher identified complex untested components (forms, lists, modals, navigation)
- ✅ **Custom Hooks Analysis**: 8 out of 9 custom hooks lack testing (useImageGeneration, useForm, useApp, useCampaign, useEncounter, useClient, useLocalStorage, useToast)
- ✅ **API Client Layer Analysis**: 20+ untested API functions across 12 client modules (baseClient, authClient, characterClient, campaignClient, etc.)
- ✅ **Context Providers Analysis**: Zero test coverage for all 4 context providers (AppContext, EncounterContext, ToastContext, LocalStorageContext)

**Critical Findings:**
- **50+ high-priority functions/components** identified requiring Jest coverage
- **20+ critical edge cases** missing from existing test suites
- **Zero test coverage** for authentication system (highest business risk)
- **Zero test coverage** for real-time features (WebSocket, contexts)
- **Zero test coverage** for API communication layer

**Risk Assessment Completed:**
- **CRITICAL RISK**: Authentication system failures (useApp, authClient) - Complete app inaccessibility
- **HIGH RISK**: Real-time features (contexts, WebSocket) - Game session failures
- **HIGH RISK**: Data persistence (API clients) - User data loss potential

**Implementation Plan Delivered:**
- **Phase 1**: Critical Infrastructure (50-75 tests) - Authentication & core state
- **Phase 2**: Business Logic (75-100 tests) - Domain operations & real-time features  
- **Phase 3**: Component Integration (50-75 tests) - Forms & UI components
- **Phase 4**: Edge Cases & Polish (25-50 tests) - Boundary conditions & performance

**Path to Comprehensive Coverage:**
- Current: 344 tests → Target: 500+ tests (45% increase)
- Addresses all major untested areas identified
- Systematic approach with proper mock infrastructure
- Risk-based prioritization focusing on business impact
