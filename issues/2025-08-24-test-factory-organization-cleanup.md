# Test Factory Organization Cleanup

**Date**: 2025-08-24
**Priority**: High
**Category**: Testing
**Status**: Resolved

## Description

The test suite had organizational issues with factory files, including duplicate factory files with inconsistent naming, broken imports, and missing factory functions. This caused 10 test suites to fail during execution.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Duplicate Factory Files
- Multiple factory files with inconsistent naming conventions
- Capitalized versions: `Characters.ts`, `Vehicles.ts`, `Weapons.ts`
- Lowercase versions: `character.ts`, `vehicle.ts`, `weapon.ts`, `campaign.ts`, `fight.ts`, `schtick.ts`, `user.ts`
- The lowercase versions were unused but causing confusion

### 2. Missing Factory Functions
- Test files were importing `createMock*` functions from non-existent lowercase factory files
- Functions needed: `createMockCharacter`, `createMockFight`, `createMockWeapon`, `createMockSchtick`, `createMockUser`, `createMockCampaign`

### 3. Disabled Test File
- `getServerClient.spec.ts.disabled` was present but not being executed

### 4. No Test Directory Organization
- Missing directories for page-level and integration tests
- No documentation for test organization patterns

## Resolution Steps

### 1. Removed Duplicate Factory Files
```bash
# Removed unused lowercase factory files
rm __tests__/factories/character.ts
rm __tests__/factories/vehicle.ts
rm __tests__/factories/weapon.ts
rm __tests__/factories/campaign.ts
rm __tests__/factories/fight.ts
rm __tests__/factories/schtick.ts
rm __tests__/factories/user.ts
```

### 2. Created Consolidated Mock Factory
Created `__tests__/factories/MockFactories.ts` with all missing factory functions:
- `createMockCharacter()`
- `createMockFight()`
- `createMockWeapon()`
- `createMockSchtick()`
- `createMockUser()`
- `createMockCampaign()`

Note: `createMockVehicle()` already existed in `Vehicles.ts`

### 3. Fixed All Import Statements
Updated imports in 10 test files to use the correct factory locations:
- `components/initiative/Initiative.spec.tsx`
- `components/attacks/AttackModal.spec.tsx`
- `components/navbar/Navbar.spec.tsx`
- `components/weapons/WeaponModal.spec.tsx`
- `components/campaigns/CampaignModal.spec.tsx`
- `components/vehicles/VehicleModal.spec.tsx`
- `components/schticks/SchtickModal.spec.tsx`
- `components/fights/FightDetail.spec.tsx`
- `components/characters/edit/EditCharacter.spec.tsx`
- `components/fights/Sequence.spec.tsx`

### 4. Created Test Directory Structure
```
__tests__/
├── pages/          # NEW - For page-level integration tests
├── integration/    # NEW - For multi-component integration tests
├── e2e/           # NEW - For end-to-end tests
└── README.md      # NEW - Documentation for test organization
```

### 5. Removed Disabled Test
Removed `__tests__/utils/getServerClient.spec.ts.disabled`

## Results

### Before
- Test Suites: 10 failed, 61 passed, 71 total
- TypeScript compilation errors
- Import resolution failures

### After
- Test Suites: 10 fixed, 61 passed, 71 total
- Tests: 1628 passed, 1628 total
- All imports resolved correctly
- Clean factory organization

## Remaining Work

### High Priority
1. Add page-level tests for authentication flows (currently 0% coverage)
2. Add integration tests for campaign activation
3. Create WebSocket connection tests

### Medium Priority
1. Move existing integration tests from `services/` to `integration/` directory
2. Add component tests for missing coverage areas (69% of components lack tests)

## Files Changed

### Modified
- 10 test files with updated imports

### Created
- `__tests__/factories/MockFactories.ts`
- `__tests__/README.md`
- `__tests__/pages/README.md`
- `__tests__/integration/README.md`
- `TEST_AUDIT_SUMMARY.md`

### Deleted
- 7 duplicate lowercase factory files
- 1 disabled test file

## Impact

- ✅ All tests now pass successfully
- ✅ Consistent factory naming convention
- ✅ Clear test organization structure
- ✅ Better documentation for future test development
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
