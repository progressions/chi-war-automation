# Issue: Entity Show Pages Editing Completeness Audit

**Date**: 2025-08-20  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Category**: UI/UX  
**Status**: Open

## Description

The application has Show pages for all major entities (Campaigns, Characters, Fights, Vehicles, Schticks, Weapons, Sites, Parties, Factions, Junctures, Users), but there's no systematic audit to ensure each Show page allows editing of all important fields for that entity. Some pages may have missing inline editing capabilities for key fields, forcing users to navigate away to separate edit forms or making certain data read-only when it should be editable.

A comprehensive survey is needed to identify gaps in inline editing functionality across all entity Show pages and ensure consistent, complete editing experiences for users.

## Current State Analysis

### Identified Show Pages (11 Total)

**Entity Show Components:**
- `campaigns/Show.tsx` - Campaign details and member management
- `characters/Show.tsx` - Character stats, equipment, relationships  
- `fights/Show.tsx` - Fight management, participants, settings
- `vehicles/Show.tsx` - Vehicle stats and combat properties
- `schticks/Show.tsx` - Schtick descriptions, categories, prerequisites
- `weapons/Show.tsx` - Weapon stats, junctures, categories
- `sites/Show.tsx` - Site descriptions and relationships
- `parties/Show.tsx` - Party membership and details
- `factions/Show.tsx` - Faction relationships and descriptions
- `junctures/Show.tsx` - Juncture details and time periods
- `users/Show.tsx` - User profiles and campaign memberships

### Known Editing Patterns

**Common Editing Components Observed:**
- `NameEditor` - Inline name editing (appears to be standard)
- `EditableRichText` - Description/content inline editing
- `HeroImage` - Image upload and positioning
- `SpeedDialMenu` - Delete functionality
- Various entity-specific editors (e.g., `ActionValuesEdit`, `EditType`)

**Potential Gaps:**
- Some entities may be missing critical field editors
- Inconsistent editing UI patterns across entities
- Fields that require separate forms when inline editing would be better
- Read-only displays for fields that should be editable

## Investigation Scope

### Phase 1: Field Inventory
For each entity, identify all editable fields from backend models:

**Campaign Fields:**
- `name` ✓ (NameEditor confirmed)
- `description` ✓ (EditableRichText confirmed)  
- `image_url` ✓ (HeroImage confirmed)
- Member management ✓ (Manager component confirmed)
- Settings/preferences (investigate)

**Character Fields:**
- `name`, `description`, `image` (basic fields)
- `character_type`, `archetype`, `juncture` (character properties)
- Action values (Body, Chi, Mind, Reflexes, Move)
- Skills (various skill categories)
- `wealth_level`, `armor_rating` (numeric stats)
- Relationships (weapons, schticks, parties, sites, factions)

**Fight Fields:**
- `name`, `description`, `image` (basic fields)
- `shot_counter`, `sequence_number` (fight mechanics)
- `active` status (start/stop fight)
- Participant management (characters, vehicles)
- Fight settings and rules

**Vehicle Fields:**
- `name`, `description`, `image` (basic fields)
- Action values (Acceleration, Handling, Frame, Crunch)
- `passenger_capacity`, `armor_rating` (numeric stats)
- `vehicle_type` (category/classification)
- Relationships and equipment

**Weapon Fields:**
- `name`, `description`, `image` (basic fields)
- `damage`, `concealment` (numeric stats)
- `juncture_id` (time period association)
- `category_id` (weapon category)
- Usage and availability settings

**Schtick Fields:**
- `name`, `description`, `image` (basic fields)
- `category`, `path` (schtick classification)
- Prerequisites and requirements
- Activation costs and effects

**Site Fields:**
- `name`, `description`, `image` (basic fields)
- Location and significance
- Relationships (parties, factions, characters)
- Juncture associations

**Party Fields:**
- `name`, `description`, `image` (basic fields)
- Member management
- Goals and objectives
- Faction allegiances

**Faction Fields:**
- `name`, `description`, `image` (basic fields)
- Relationships with other factions
- Associated sites, parties, junctures
- Influence and power level

**Juncture Fields:**
- `name`, `description`, `image` (basic fields)
- Time period details
- Associated entities
- Historical context

**User Fields:**
- `first_name`, `last_name`, `email` (basic profile)
- Campaign memberships and roles
- Preferences and settings
- Avatar/profile image

### Phase 2: Editing Capability Assessment

For each field, determine:
1. **Currently Editable Inline?** - Can users edit directly on Show page?
2. **Editing Method** - What component/UI is used for editing?
3. **User Experience Quality** - Is the editing experience intuitive and efficient?
4. **Missing Functionality** - What fields can't be edited inline but should be?

### Phase 3: Consistency Analysis

Identify inconsistencies:
- Entities that use different patterns for similar fields
- Missing standard components (NameEditor, EditableRichText, etc.)
- Inconsistent image upload/management
- Different approaches to relationship management

### Phase 4: Gap Identification and Prioritization

**Critical Gaps (High Priority):**
- Core identifying fields (name, type, category) not inline editable
- Frequently changed fields requiring separate forms
- Important numeric stats lacking inline editors

**Moderate Gaps (Medium Priority):**  
- Relationship management inconsistencies
- Missing batch editing capabilities
- Incomplete field validation feedback

**Minor Gaps (Low Priority):**
- Aesthetic inconsistencies in editing UI
- Advanced editing features for power users
- Accessibility improvements for editing components

## Expected Outcomes

After completing this audit:

1. **Comprehensive Field Matrix**: Document all fields for each entity and their editing status
2. **Gap Analysis Report**: Prioritized list of missing editing capabilities
3. **Consistency Recommendations**: Standard patterns for common editing scenarios
4. **Implementation Roadmap**: Phased approach to address identified gaps
5. **Quality Standards**: Guidelines for future Show page editing implementations

## Investigation Methodology

### Step 1: Model Analysis
```bash
# For each entity model, extract editable fields
cd shot-server
grep -n "attr_accessible\|strong_params\|permit" app/models/*.rb
grep -n "validates\|validates_presence_of" app/models/*.rb
```

### Step 2: Component Analysis
```bash
# For each Show component, identify editing patterns
cd shot-client-next
grep -n "Editor\|Editable\|onChange\|updateEntity" src/components/*/Show.tsx
```

### Step 3: User Flow Testing
- Navigate through each entity Show page
- Attempt to edit every visible field
- Document fields that require separate forms/pages
- Note UI/UX inconsistencies

### Step 4: Cross-Reference Analysis
- Compare editing capabilities across similar entities
- Identify common patterns and outliers
- Document best practices and problematic patterns
