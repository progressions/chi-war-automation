# Issue: User Context Cache Inconsistency - Wrong User Shown in Navigation Menu

**Date**: 2025-08-20  
**Priority**: High  
**Category**: Frontend/Authentication  
**Status**: Completed

## Description

There is an inconsistency in the user context system where different parts of the application show different users. The navigation menu components (`MainMenu.tsx` and `CampaignRequiredMenu.tsx`) are displaying the wrong user object, showing admin privileges for a user who should be a regular player. This creates a security concern as users can see menu items they shouldn't have access to.

The issue manifests as the navigation menu showing the user as an admin/gamemaster (`progressions@gmail.com`) when the user is actually signed in as a regular player (`progressions+david@gmail.com`). The profile page correctly shows the user as David, but the menu shows Isaac's user object with admin privileges.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Sign in as a regular player user (e.g., `progressions+david@gmail.com`)
2. Navigate to profile page - correctly shows David's information
3. Open the hamburger menu (three lines icon)
4. Observe that "Users" menu item appears (should only be visible to admins)
5. Check browser console logs - shows user object for `progressions@gmail.com` instead of `progressions+david@gmail.com`

## Expected Behavior

- Navigation menu should show the same user that is displayed on the profile page
- Regular players should not see admin-only menu items like "Users"
- All parts of the application should use the same, consistent user context
- Menu should only show "Users" link when `user.admin === true` for the actual signed-in user

## Actual Behavior

- Navigation menu shows wrong user object (`progressions@gmail.com` instead of `progressions+david@gmail.com`)
- Regular player sees admin-only "Users" menu item
- Console logs show `user.admin: true user.gamemaster: true` for wrong user
- Profile page shows correct user (David) but menu shows different user (Isaac)

- Profile page components that correctly show the user

## Screenshots/Evidence

Browser console logs show:
```
CampaignRequiredMenu user object: {id: 'dd8dd378-deab-44c0-b361-a8840f39bc30', email: 'progressions@gmail.com', ...}
user.admin: true user.gamemaster: true
```

When user is actually signed in as `progressions+david@gmail.com` (confirmed by profile page).

## Investigation Notes

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue appears to be in the AppContext localStorage caching mechanism in `AppContext.tsx` lines 165-182:

1. **Caching Key Issue**: Users are cached by JWT token (`currentUser-${jwt}`)
2. **Cache Pollution**: When multiple users sign in on the same browser, cached user objects may persist
3. **Inconsistent Data Sources**: Different parts of the app may be getting user data from different sources

### Technical Details
- AppContext uses `localStorage.getItem(\`currentUser-${jwt}\`)` to cache users
- If cached user exists, it's used instead of fetching from API
- This can lead to wrong user being loaded if cache is corrupted or contains stale data
- Profile page likely fetches user directly from API, bypassing cache

### Security Implications
- Users see menu items they shouldn't have access to
- Potential for privilege escalation if user object is trusted for authorization
- Inconsistent user context creates confusion and potential security vulnerabilities

## Potential Solution

### Immediate Fix
1. Clear localStorage cache for affected users
2. Add better cache invalidation logic

### Long-term Solutions
1. **Improve Cache Key Strategy**:
   - Include user ID in cache key: `currentUser-${jwt}-${userId}`
   - Validate cached user matches current session

2. **Add Cache Validation**:
   - Always verify cached user against API response
   - Clear cache if user mismatch detected

3. **Consistent User Context**:
   - Ensure all components use same user source
   - Add user context debugging/validation

4. **Better Error Handling**:
   - Detect and handle user context mismatches
   - Provide user feedback when cache issues occur

### Code Changes Needed
```typescript
// In AppContext.tsx - add user validation
const cachedUser = localStorage.getItem(`currentUser-${jwt}`)
if (cachedUser) {
  const parsedUser = JSON.parse(cachedUser)
  // Validate cached user against fresh API call
  const freshUser = await client.getCurrentUser()
  if (parsedUser.id !== freshUser.data.id) {
    // Cache mismatch - clear and use fresh data
    localStorage.removeItem(`currentUser-${jwt}`)
    // Continue with fresh user
  }
}
```

## Related Issues

None currently, but this may be related to any other authentication or user context issues.

## Workaround

Users experiencing this issue can:
1. Clear browser localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
2. Refresh page and sign in again
3. Or clear specific cache keys in browser developer tools
