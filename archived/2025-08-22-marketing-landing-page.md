**Date**: 2025-08-22  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Category**: Frontend/UX  
**Status**: Closed  
**Completed**: 2025-08-22

## Issue Description

Create an engaging marketing landing page that displays when users visit the root directory (/) without being signed in. This page should serve as the primary entry point for new users, showcasing Chi War's capabilities and encouraging sign-ups.

## Current State

- The root route (/) currently requires authentication
- Non-authenticated users are redirected to login page
- No marketing content or user acquisition flow exists

## Required Changes

### 1. Create Marketing Landing Page Component

Create a new server-side rendered marketing page at the root route that includes:

- **Hero Section**
  - Compelling headline about Chi War
  - Subtitle explaining Feng Shui 2 campaign management
  - Primary CTA button for sign-up
  - Secondary CTA for login

- **Feature Showcase**
  - Real-time combat management
  - Character creation and management
  - Campaign organization tools
  - Discord integration
  - AI-powered character generation
  - Cross-juncture campaign support

- **Screenshots Section**
  - Placeholder for campaign dashboard screenshot
  - Placeholder for character sheet screenshot
  - Placeholder for combat encounter screenshot
  - Placeholder for character creation screenshot

- **Feng Shui 2 Themed Imagery**
  - Placeholder for martial arts action scene
  - Placeholder for ancient Chinese mystical imagery
  - Placeholder for cyberpunk future juncture imagery
  - Placeholder for colonial Hong Kong atmosphere

- **Social Proof Section**
  - Testimonials (placeholder content)
  - User statistics (if available)
  - Community highlights

- **Footer Integration**
  - Use existing enhanced footer component
  - Include links to About, Documentation, Support

### 2. Update Routing Logic

- Modify authentication middleware to allow unauthenticated access to root route
- Create conditional routing:
  - Authenticated users: redirect to dashboard
  - Unauthenticated users: show marketing page
- Ensure proper server-side rendering for SEO

### 3. Marketing Content Requirements

**Enchanting Action Descriptions:**
- "Master the Art of Cinematic Combat" - Real-time initiative tracking
- "Forge Legends Across Time" - Cross-juncture character development
- "Command Epic Battles" - Dynamic encounter management
- "Unleash Ancient Powers" - Schtick and skill management
- "Rally Your Heroes" - Party and faction coordination

**Feature Descriptions:**
- Emphasize the cinematic nature of Feng Shui 2
- Highlight time-jumping adventures across four junctures
- Showcase collaborative storytelling tools
- Demonstrate real-time multiplayer capabilities

**Call-to-Action Elements:**
- "Start Your Legendary Campaign" (primary signup)
- "Join the Action" (secondary signup)
- "Already a Hero? Login" (login link)
- "Explore Documentation" (learn more)

### 4. Image Placeholders to Create

**Screenshots (to be captured later):**
- `hero-dashboard.png` - Main campaign dashboard
- `character-sheet-demo.png` - Character sheet interface
- `combat-encounter.png` - Live combat session
- `character-creation.png` - AI character generation

**Feng Shui 2 Themed Images (to be sourced/created):**
- `ancient-martial-arts.jpg` - Ancient juncture atmosphere
- `cyberpunk-future.jpg` - Future juncture cyberpunk scene
- `colonial-hongkong.jpg` - 1850s colonial atmosphere
- `contemporary-action.jpg` - Modern action movie scene

**UI Elements:**
- `chi-war-logo-large.png` - Hero section logo
- `feature-icons/` - Icon set for feature highlights

### 5. Technical Implementation

- Use Next.js App Router with server-side rendering
- Implement responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Add proper SEO metadata for marketing page
- Include structured data markup for search engines
- Ensure fast loading times with optimized images (when added)
- Add conversion tracking hooks for analytics

## Expected Behavior

**For Unauthenticated Users:**
- Visit `/` → See marketing landing page
- Engaging content encourages sign-up
- Clear navigation to login, documentation, and support
- Mobile-optimized experience

**For Authenticated Users:**
- Visit `/` → Redirect to dashboard (existing behavior)
- No change to current user experience

## Technical Implementation Notes

### File Structure
```
src/app/
├── (marketing)/
│   ├── layout.tsx          # Marketing layout (no auth required)
│   └── page.tsx            # Marketing landing page
├── (main)/                 # Existing authenticated routes
│   └── ...
└── middleware.ts           # Updated to allow marketing routes
```

### Component Structure
```
src/components/marketing/
├── HeroSection.tsx         # Hero with headline and CTAs
├── FeatureShowcase.tsx     # Feature highlights
├── ScreenshotGallery.tsx   # Product screenshots
├── TestimonialsSection.tsx # Social proof
└── CallToAction.tsx        # Final conversion section
```

### Image Placeholder Implementation
```tsx
// Example placeholder component
<div className="image-placeholder" style={{ aspectRatio: '16/9', backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0' }}>
  <span>Screenshot: Campaign Dashboard</span>
  <small>1920x1080 recommended</small>
</div>
```

## Design Considerations

1. **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear progression from hero to features to CTA
2. **Feng Shui 2 Theming**: Incorporate cinematic action movie aesthetics
3. **Conversion Focus**: Multiple sign-up opportunities without being pushy
4. **Performance**: Fast loading for good first impressions
5. **Accessibility**: Screen reader friendly and keyboard navigable

## Success Metrics

- Increased sign-up conversion rate
- Reduced bounce rate on landing page
- Improved SEO rankings for Feng Shui 2 related terms
- Higher user engagement before authentication

## Priority Justification

Medium priority as this improves user acquisition and provides professional entry point, but doesn't affect existing user functionality. Should be implemented after core features are stable.
