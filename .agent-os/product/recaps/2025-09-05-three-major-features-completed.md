### 3. Impairment Display & Calculation System

**Specification:** `.agent-os/specs/2025-08-31-encounter-manager-completion/` (Impairment System)
**Status:** Completed and deployed to production
**Size:** Large (L)

**Summary:**
Implemented a comprehensive impairment calculation and display system that automatically computes and prominently shows wound-based combat penalties for all character types. The system provides real-time updates and clear visual indicators throughout the interface.

**Key Accomplishments:**
- Created ImpairmentBadge component with color-coded visual indicators
- Implemented automatic impairment calculation based on wound thresholds and character types
- Added different impairment thresholds for PC/NPC (30/35), Boss (50+), Uber-Boss (60+), and Mook (none)
- Integrated real-time impairment updates throughout the interface
- Displayed both base and adjusted values with clear formatting: "AV 15 (-1) = 14"
- Implemented color-coded indicators: green (healthy), yellow (1 impairment), red (2+ impairment)
- Integrated impairment calculations with boost effects for accurate final values
- Added comprehensive impairment display in shot counter, attack panel, and character cards

**Technical Implementation:**
- **ImpairmentBadge.tsx**: Core visual indicator component with Material-UI styling
- **CharacterEffectService**: Calculation utilities for impairment effects
- **SharedService**: Cross-component impairment calculation functions
- **Real-time integration**: Automatic updates across all interface components
- **Attack/Defense integration**: Seamless incorporation into combat calculations

**User Impact:**
The system automatically handles complex wound penalty calculations, reducing manual math and ensuring accurate combat mechanics. Players and GMs can instantly see how wounds affect character capabilities through clear visual indicators.
