# Admin Template Filter - Lite Summary

Implement an admin-only template filter dropdown in the character list EntityFilters accordion with three options (All, Templates Only, Non-Templates Only) to control character template visibility. Non-admin users never see templates and cannot access the filter, while admins can toggle between viewing templates, non-templates, or all characters with URL persistence for the filter state.

## Key Points
- Admin-only filter dropdown in EntityFilters accordion for character list
- Three filter options: All, Templates Only, Non-Templates Only
- Non-admin users cannot see templates or access the filter
- URL state persistence for filter selection
