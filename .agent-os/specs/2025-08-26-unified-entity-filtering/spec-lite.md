# Spec Summary (Lite)

Consolidate the dual filtering UI on entity index pages by moving the filter bar (GenericFilter) into the existing filter accordion, creating a single, unified filtering interface. This reduces UI clutter, improves mobile experience, and provides clear active filter indicators while maintaining all current filtering functionality and URL-based persistence.
