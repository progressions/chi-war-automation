# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Avatar ImageViewer Integration
> Created: 2025-08-27

## Overview

Integrate the existing ImageViewer component with all entity Avatar components to allow users to view full-size images by clicking on avatars. This enhancement improves the visual experience during gameplay by providing quick access to character artwork, campaign imagery, and other entity visuals.

## User Stories

### Gamemaster Quick Character Reference

As a Gamemaster, I want to click on any character avatar during a fight scene, so that I can quickly view the full character artwork to describe them to my players.

During an active fight scene, the GM needs to reference multiple NPCs, bosses, and mooks. By clicking on their avatars in the fight tracker or character lists, they can instantly view the full artwork without navigating away from the current screen. This helps maintain game flow while providing rich visual descriptions.

### Player Character Inspection

As a Player, I want to click on character avatars in my campaign, so that I can view detailed character portraits of my party members and NPCs we encounter.

Players frequently need to reference character appearances when role-playing interactions or planning tactics. Click-to-view functionality on avatars throughout the application allows seamless access to character visuals during gameplay, enhancing immersion and helping players visualize the game world.

### Campaign World Building

As a Gamemaster, I want to click on site, faction, and other entity avatars, so that I can quickly show visual references to my players during world-building and storytelling.

When describing locations, organizations, and other campaign elements, GMs can click on entity avatars to display full images. This visual storytelling tool helps players better understand and engage with the campaign setting.

## Spec Scope

1. **Avatar Click Handler** - Add onClick functionality to all entity Avatar components to trigger ImageViewer
2. **Hover State Indication** - Implement visual feedback on avatar hover to indicate clickability
3. **ImageViewer Integration** - Connect Avatar components to the existing ImageViewer component
4. **Loading State** - Display loading indicator while full-size images are being fetched
5. **Universal Coverage** - Apply to all entity types: Campaign, Fight, Character, Vehicle, Site, Faction, Schtick, Weapon, Juncture, and User avatars

## Out of Scope

- Modifications to the existing ImageViewer component functionality
- Image editing or upload capabilities from the viewer
- Batch image viewing or gallery navigation
- Custom zoom/pan controls beyond existing ImageViewer features
- Avatar image replacement or cropping tools

## Expected Deliverable

1. All entity Avatar components are clickable and open the ImageViewer with the corresponding image
2. Visual hover feedback indicates avatars are interactive (cursor change, subtle effect)
3. Loading states handle image fetch delays gracefully without UI disruption
