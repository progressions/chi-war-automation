# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-27-avatar-imageviewer-integration/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-27
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Avatar Component Updates
- Add `onClick` handler to all entity Avatar components (CampaignAvatar, FightAvatar, CharacterAvatar, VehicleAvatar, SiteAvatar, FactionAvatar, SchtickAvatar, WeaponAvatar, JunctureAvatar, UserAvatar)
- Implement cursor pointer style on hover to indicate clickability
- Add subtle hover effect using Material-UI's `sx` prop or styled components (e.g., slight scale or opacity change)
- Ensure click handlers don't interfere with parent component click events (use event.stopPropagation)

### ImageViewer Integration
- Import and use the existing ImageViewer component from the codebase
- Pass image URL and entity name/title as props to ImageViewer
- Handle state management for opening/closing the viewer within each Avatar component
- Implement loading state while image is being fetched using Material-UI's CircularProgress or Skeleton component

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy load the ImageViewer component only when needed using React.lazy()
- Ensure hover effects are performant using CSS transitions rather than JavaScript animations
- Optimize click handler attachment to avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Use React.memo() on Avatar components if not already implemented to prevent unnecessary re-renders

### Accessibility Requirements
- Add appropriate ARIA labels to indicate avatars are clickable (`role="button"`, `tabIndex={0}`)
- Support keyboard activation (Enter/Space keys) in addition to mouse clicks
- Ensure ImageViewer modal traps focus and can be closed with Escape key
- Maintain proper focus management when ImageViewer opens and closes

### Error Handling
- Display fallback placeholder if image fails to load
- Show appropriate error state in ImageViewer for broken images
- Log errors to console for debugging but don't break the UI
- Gracefully handle null/undefined image URLs

### Mobile Responsiveness
- Ensure touch events work properly on mobile devices
- Test that hover effects don't interfere with touch interactions
- Verify ImageViewer displays correctly on various screen sizes
- Consider touch-friendly interaction patterns (tap to open)

## Approach

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Update core Avatar components with click handlers and hover effects
2. **Phase 2**: Integrate ImageViewer component with proper state management
3. **Phase 3**: Add accessibility features and keyboard support
4. **Phase 4**: Implement performance optimizations and error handling
5. **Phase 5**: Test mobile responsiveness and touch interactions

### Component Architecture
- Each Avatar component will manage its own ImageViewer state (open/closed)
- Use React hooks (useState) for local state management
- Implement consistent interface across all Avatar components
- Maintain existing Avatar component APIs while adding new functionality

### Event Handling Pattern
```typescript
const handleAvatarClick = (event: React.MouseEvent) => {
  event.stopPropagation();
  setImageViewerOpen(true);
};

const handleKeyDown = (event: React.KeyboardEvent) => {
  if (event.key === 'Enter' || event.key === ' ') {
    event.preventDefault();
    setImageViewerOpen(true);
  }
};
```

## External Dependencies

### Existing Components
- ImageViewer component (already exists in codebase)
- Material-UI components (Avatar, CircularProgress, Skeleton)
- React hooks (useState, useCallback, React.lazy)

### No New Dependencies Required
- All functionality can be implemented using existing packages
- No additional npm packages needed
- Leverages existing UI component library (Material-UI)

### Browser API Requirements
- Focus management APIs for accessibility
- Keyboard event handling
- Touch event support for mobile devices
