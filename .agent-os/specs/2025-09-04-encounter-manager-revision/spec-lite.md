# Spec Summary (Lite)

Redesign the encounter manager to use character-first selection, displaying characters grouped by shot position at the top of the interface. Users select a character from the shot-grouped display, then choose from available actions (Attack, Boost, Chase), streamlining combat workflow and reducing clicks compared to the current action-first approach.
