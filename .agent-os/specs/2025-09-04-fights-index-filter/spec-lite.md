# Spec Summary (Lite)

Change the default value of the Status filter on the fights index from "All" to "Unstarted". Update GenericFilter component to support defaultValue in filterConfigs, ensuring the fights index shows only unstarted fights by default while maintaining full filtering capabilities through the existing dropdown and URL parameters.
