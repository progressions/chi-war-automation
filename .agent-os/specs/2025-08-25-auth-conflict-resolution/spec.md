> Spec: Authentication Conflict Resolution
> Created: 2025-08-25
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement automatic detection and resolution of authentication conflicts between frontend localStorage and backend user state that occur when switching between test and development environments. This feature will prevent application breakage by gracefully clearing conflicted authentication data and redirecting users to login.

## User Stories

### Silent Authentication Conflict Resolution

As a developer switching between test and development environments, I want authentication conflicts to be automatically resolved, so that I don't experience application breakage or need to manually clear browser data.

When the AppContext detects that localStorage contains user data for a different user than what the backend `/api/v2/users/current` endpoint returns, the system should silently clear all frontend authentication data, perform a stateless backend logout, and redirect to the login page without user intervention.

## Spec Scope

1. **Conflict Detection** - Compare localStorage user data with backend current user response in AppContext
2. **Frontend Cleanup** - Clear localStorage, sessionStorage, cookies, and AppContext user state 
3. **Backend Reset** - Perform stateless logout API call to clear backend session
4. **Silent Redirect** - Automatically redirect to `/login` page without user notification
5. **Integration with AppContext** - Implement detection logic within existing authentication context

## Out of Scope

- User notifications about conflict resolution
- Different behavior between development and production environments
- Recovery of user's previous session or data
- Conflict prevention mechanisms

## Expected Deliverable

1. Authentication conflicts between environments are automatically detected and resolved without application breakage
2. Users are silently redirected to login page when conflicts occur, allowing them to authenticate properly
3. All frontend and backend authentication state is properly cleared during conflict resolution
