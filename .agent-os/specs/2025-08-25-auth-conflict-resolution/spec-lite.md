# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement automatic detection and resolution of authentication conflicts between frontend localStorage and backend user state that occur when switching between test and development environments. The system will silently clear all authentication data, perform backend logout, and redirect to login when conflicts are detected in AppContext.
