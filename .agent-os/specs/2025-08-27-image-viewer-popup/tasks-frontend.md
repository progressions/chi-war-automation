## Implementation Summary

The Image Viewer Popup System has been successfully implemented with the following key components:

### Core Implementation

- **PositionableImage.tsx**: Updated with click handlers to trigger the modal
- **Avatar.tsx**: Integrated with modal functionality for character portraits

### Key Features Delivered
- **Click-to-expand functionality**: All entity images (characters, vehicles, sites, etc.) can be clicked to view full-size
- **Multiple dismiss methods**: ESC key, backdrop click, and close button
- **Responsive display**: Images scale appropriately for different viewport sizes
- **Smooth animations**: GPU-accelerated fade-in/out and scale transitions
- **Accessibility compliance**: ARIA labels, focus management, and screen reader support
- **Performance optimizations**: Lazy loading and efficient memory management

### Integration Points
- **Universal image support**: Works with all entity types throughout the application
- **Existing UI preservation**: Maintains all existing functionality while adding new capabilities
- **Consistent user experience**: Follows Material-UI design patterns and application conventions

The feature is now fully functional and provides users with an intuitive way to view entity images at full resolution across the entire application.
