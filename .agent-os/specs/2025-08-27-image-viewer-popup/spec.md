# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Image Viewer Popup
> Created: 2025-08-27
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a full-screen image viewer popup that displays entity images in their original size when users click on thumbnail images. This feature will provide an easily dismissible modal overlay for viewing character portraits, vehicle images, and other entity visuals at full resolution without leaving the current page context.

## User Stories

### View Full Character Portrait

As a gamemaster, I want to click on a character's thumbnail image, so that I can view the full-resolution portrait to better describe the character to players.

When viewing a character's details page or character card, clicking on the character's portrait thumbnail will open a full-screen modal overlay displaying the image at its original size. The modal can be dismissed by clicking outside the image, pressing ESC, or clicking a close button. This allows gamemasters to quickly show character portraits to players during gameplay without navigating away from the current view.

### Quick Vehicle Reference

As a player, I want to click on vehicle images in the vehicle list, so that I can see detailed vehicle artwork during chase scenes.

While browsing the vehicle list or viewing vehicle details, clicking any vehicle thumbnail will display the full image in a popup overlay. The overlay preserves the current scroll position and page state, allowing players to quickly reference vehicle appearance during fast-paced chase sequences without losing their place in the interface.

## Spec Scope

1. **Click-to-Open Interaction** - Thumbnail images become clickable to trigger the full image viewer popup
2. **Modal Overlay Display** - Full-screen semi-transparent overlay that displays the image at original size
3. **Multiple Dismiss Methods** - Close via clicking outside, ESC key, or explicit close button
4. **Image Scaling Options** - Fit-to-screen by default with option to view at 100% scale for high-resolution images
5. **Loading State** - Display loading indicator while full-resolution image loads

## Out of Scope

- Image editing or annotation capabilities
- Image gallery navigation (viewing multiple images in sequence)
- Image download functionality
- Zoom pan gestures for mobile devices
- Image metadata display

## Expected Deliverable

1. Clicking any entity thumbnail image opens a full-screen modal overlay displaying the full-resolution image
2. Modal can be dismissed via clicking the backdrop, pressing ESC key, or clicking the close button
3. Images maintain aspect ratio and scale appropriately to fit the viewport with option to view at 100% scale
