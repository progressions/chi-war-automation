## Tasks

### 1. PDF Parser Enhancement for Backup Action Values

**Goal:** Enhance the existing PDF parsing system to recognize and extract backup action values from character sheets.

1.1. Write comprehensive test cases for backup action parsing
   - [x] Create test PDF samples with various backup action formats
   - [x] Add unit tests for regex pattern matching
   - [x] Test edge cases (missing values, malformed entries, multiple backups)

1.2. Update get_secondary_attack_from_pdf function with backup action parsing
   - [x] Extend existing regex patterns to match "Backup Attack: [Skill]: [Value]" format
   - [x] Handle variations in formatting and whitespace
   - [x] Maintain backward compatibility with existing secondary attack parsing

1.3. Integrate character service helper functions for setting action values
   - [x] Utilize existing character service methods for action value assignment
   - [x] Ensure proper data type conversion and validation
   - [x] Follow established patterns from current PDF parsing implementation

1.4. Verify all backup action parsing tests pass
   - [x] Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
   - [x] Validate parsing accuracy across different PDF formats
   - [x] Confirm backward compatibility with existing functionality

### 2. Data Validation and Error Handling

**Goal:** Implement robust validation and error handling for parsed backup action values.

2.1. Write tests for validation scenarios
   - [x] Test invalid action values (non-numeric, out of range)
   - [x] Test unknown skill names or typos
   - [x] Test missing or incomplete backup action entries

2.2. Implement validation logic for parsed backup actions
   - [x] Validate action values are within acceptable ranges (1-15+ typical)
   - [x] Cross-reference skill names against valid skill list
   - [x] Handle partial or corrupted data gracefully

2.3. Add comprehensive error handling and logging
   - [x] Log parsing attempts and results for debugging
   - [x] Provide meaningful error messages for validation failures
   - [x] Ensure graceful degradation when backup actions cannot be parsed

2.4. Verify all validation tests pass
   - [x] Run validation test suite
   - [x] Confirm error handling works as expected
   - [x] Validate logging output provides useful debugging information

### 3. Integration Testing and Documentation

**Goal:** Ensure seamless integration with existing character import workflow and update documentation.

3.1. Write integration tests for complete PDF import workflow
   - [x] Test end-to-end character creation from PDF with backup actions
   - [x] Verify backup actions appear correctly in character sheets
   - [x] Test integration with existing character management features

3.2. Update character import service integration
   - [x] Ensure parsed backup actions are properly saved to character model
   - [x] Verify character display includes backup action information
   - [x] Test compatibility with character editing and updates

3.3. Update API documentation and comments
   - [x] Document new backup action parsing capabilities
   - [x] Add inline code comments explaining regex patterns and logic
   - [x] Update any relevant API endpoint documentation

3.4. Verify all integration tests pass and deployment readiness
   - [x] Run complete test suite including new and existing tests
   - [x] Perform manual testing of PDF import with backup actions
   - [x] Confirm feature is ready for production deployment

## Completion Notes

**Completed: 2025-08-31**

This specification has been fully implemented and deployed to production. Key accomplishments:

- Successfully enhanced PDF parsing system to extract backup action values from character sheets
- Extended existing regex patterns to handle "Backup Attack: [Skill]: [Value]" format with robust error handling
- Integrated backup action parsing with existing character service helper functions
- Implemented comprehensive validation for action values and skill name verification
- Added detailed logging and error handling for parsing failures with graceful degradation
- Created extensive test coverage including unit tests, integration tests, and E2E validation
- Maintained full backward compatibility with existing PDF parsing functionality
- Updated documentation and inline code comments for maintainability

The feature is now live in production and allows users to import character sheets with backup action values automatically parsed and applied to their characters, streamlining character creation from PDF sources.
