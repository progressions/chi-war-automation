# Spec Tasks

These are the tasks to be completed for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-29-character-pdf-backup-actions/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-29
> Status: Ready for Implementation

## Tasks

### 1. PDF Parser Enhancement for Backup Action Values

**Goal:** Enhance the existing PDF parsing system to recognize and extract backup action values from character sheets.

1.1. Write comprehensive test cases for backup action parsing
   - Create test PDF samples with various backup action formats
   - Add unit tests for regex pattern matching
   - Test edge cases (missing values, malformed entries, multiple backups)

1.2. Update get_secondary_attack_from_pdf function with backup action parsing
   - Extend existing regex patterns to match "Backup Attack: [Skill]: [Value]" format
   - Handle variations in formatting and whitespace
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing secondary attack parsing

1.3. Integrate character service helper functions for setting action values
   - Utilize existing character service methods for action value assignment
   - Ensure proper data type conversion and validation
   - Follow established patterns from current PDF parsing implementation

1.4. Verify all backup action parsing tests pass
   - Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
   - Validate parsing accuracy across different PDF formats
   - Confirm backward compatibility with existing functionality

### 2. Data Validation and Error Handling

**Goal:** Implement robust validation and error handling for parsed backup action values.

2.1. Write tests for validation scenarios
   - Test invalid action values (non-numeric, out of range)
   - Test unknown skill names or typos
   - Test missing or incomplete backup action entries

2.2. Implement validation logic for parsed backup actions
   - Validate action values are within acceptable ranges (1-15+ typical)
   - Cross-reference skill names against valid skill list
   - Handle partial or corrupted data gracefully

2.3. Add comprehensive error handling and logging
   - Log parsing attempts and results for debugging
   - Provide meaningful error messages for validation failures
   - Ensure graceful degradation when backup actions cannot be parsed

2.4. Verify all validation tests pass
   - Run validation test suite
   - Confirm error handling works as expected
   - Validate logging output provides useful debugging information

### 3. Integration Testing and Documentation

**Goal:** Ensure seamless integration with existing character import workflow and update documentation.

3.1. Write integration tests for complete PDF import workflow
   - Test end-to-end character creation from PDF with backup actions
   - Verify backup actions appear correctly in character sheets
   - Test integration with existing character management features

3.2. Update character import service integration
   - Ensure parsed backup actions are properly saved to character model
   - Verify character display includes backup action information
   - Test compatibility with character editing and updates

3.3. Update API documentation and comments
   - Document new backup action parsing capabilities
   - Add inline code comments explaining regex patterns and logic
   - Update any relevant API endpoint documentation

3.4. Verify all integration tests pass and deployment readiness
   - Run complete test suite including new and existing tests
   - Perform manual testing of PDF import with backup actions
   - Confirm feature is ready for production deployment
