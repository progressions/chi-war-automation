- [ ] Modify onboarding visibility calculations to include dismissal checks
- [ ] Test context state persistence across user sessions
- [ ] Verify context updates trigger proper component re-renders
- [ ] Run context tests: `cd shot-client-next && npm run test:context`

**Task 3.2: API Integration for Module Dismissal**
- [ ] Write API integration tests for dismiss functionality
- [ ] Create API service methods for dismissing specific onboarding modules

**Task 4.2: Implement Onboarding Restore Logic**
- [ ] Write backend tests for onboarding progress reset functionality
- [ ] Create API endpoint handler for resetting onboarding progress fields
- [ ] Implement frontend logic to refresh onboarding state after reset
- [ ] Add confirmation step before resetting onboarding progress
- [ ] Test restore functionality returns user to initial onboarding state
- [ ] Verify restored modules appear correctly in onboarding flow
- [ ] Run restore tests: `cd test-scripts && node test-onboarding-restore.js`

### Phase 5: Integration Testing and User Experience

**Task 5.1: Comprehensive E2E Testing**
- [ ] Create comprehensive Playwright test covering full dismiss/restore workflow
- [ ] Test onboarding dismissal for new user registration flow
- [ ] Test onboarding dismissal for returning users with existing progress
- [ ] Validate dismissed modules stay hidden across browser sessions
- [ ] Test restore functionality returns proper onboarding state
- [ ] Verify no impact on existing onboarding completion tracking
- [ ] Run full E2E test: `cd test-scripts && node test-dismissable-onboarding-complete.js`

**Task 5.2: Visual and UX Testing**
- [ ] Write visual regression tests for dismiss button positioning
- [ ] Test dismiss button accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- [ ] Verify dismiss functionality works across different viewport sizes
- [ ] Test Material-UI theme consistency with dismiss buttons
- [ ] Validate smooth transitions when modules are dismissed
