# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Character Boost Feature for Combat Enhancement
> Created: 2025-09-04
> Status: Planning

## Overview

The boost feature allows characters to provide tactical support to other characters during combat by granting temporary bonuses to attack or defense capabilities. This feature implements the Feng Shui 2 mechanics where characters can spend 3-shot actions to boost allies, with PCs having the option to enhance these boosts using Fortune dice.

This feature integrates seamlessly with the existing combat system, following established patterns from the Attack Panel while introducing new tactical depth to encounter management. The system tracks active boosts through CharacterEffect records which automatically handle the visual display of temporary bonuses.

## User Stories

**As a gamemaster**, I want to enable NPCs to provide tactical support to other characters so that combat encounters have more strategic depth and cooperative elements.

**As a player**, I want to boost my allies' combat effectiveness so that I can play a support role during fights and help turn the tide of difficult encounters.

**As a player with Fortune dice**, I want to click a Fortune button to enhance my boosts (similar to Attack/Defense Fortune mechanics) so that I can provide significant tactical advantages when the situation demands it.

**As any user**, I want to see active boosts displayed through the existing CharacterEffect system so that I can see which characters have temporary bonuses and plan my actions accordingly.

**As a gamemaster**, I want the boost system to follow existing UI patterns so that players can quickly learn and use the feature without confusion.

## Spec Scope

- Implement boost action panel following Attack Panel UI patterns
- Support both attack boost (+1 to next attack, +2 with Fortune) and defense boost (+3 to Defense for next attack, +5 with Fortune)
- Character selection for both booster and target
- Fortune die enhancement option for PC characters
- CharacterEffect record creation and management for tracking active boosts
- Automatic display of boost effects through existing CharacterEffect system
- Integration with existing shot counter and initiative system
- Real-time updates via WebSocket for multiplayer sessions
- Proper authorization ensuring only campaign members can perform boosts
- Comprehensive test coverage for all boost scenarios

## Out of Scope

- Boost effects lasting multiple rounds (current spec is single-use)
- Stacking multiple boosts on the same character
- Boost effects on non-combat actions
- Custom boost values beyond the standard Feng Shui 2 mechanics
- Boost history or analytics features
- Integration with Discord notifications for boost actions

## Expected Deliverable

A fully functional boost feature that allows characters to enhance allies' combat effectiveness through a 3-shot action, complete with:

1. **User Interface**: Boost panel with character/target selection and Fortune die options
2. **Backend API**: New endpoints for creating and managing boost effects
3. **Database Schema**: CharacterEffect model extensions for boost tracking
4. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live boost notifications
5. **CharacterEffect Display**: Boost effects automatically shown through existing CharacterEffect UI
6. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive testing of all boost mechanics and edge cases

The feature should integrate seamlessly with existing combat flows while providing clear tactical options for both gamemasters and players.
