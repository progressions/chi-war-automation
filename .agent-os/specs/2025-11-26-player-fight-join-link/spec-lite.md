# Spec Summary (Lite)

Add a "Join Fight" button to the Active Fight Banner that links players directly to the player view (`/encounters/[id]/play/[characterId]`) when they own a character participating in the active fight. The button appears alongside the existing "Join Fight" link, navigating players to their character-specific view while gamemasters continue to access the encounter management view.
