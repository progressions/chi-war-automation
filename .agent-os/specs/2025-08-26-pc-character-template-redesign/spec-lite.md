# PC Character Template Redesign - Lite Summary

Redesign the PC character creation interface at /characters/create to replace the dark carousel system with a clean, modern template selection layout matching the successful GMC interface styling. Display comprehensive template information including action values, skills, schticks, and weapons on preview cards with search/filter capabilities for efficient template discovery. Enable direct click-to-create workflow without confirmation dialogs while maintaining visual consistency with the existing GMC template selection system. The specific layout approach will be determined through design iteration.
