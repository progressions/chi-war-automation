# Test Infrastructure Implementation

This document summarizes the comprehensive test reliability improvements implemented for the Campaign Membership feature.

## Overview

The test reliability improvements were implemented across 5 phases to address issues where tests were passing but the actual feature was broken. The implementation follows the specification in `../specs/test-reliability-improvements.md`.

## Phases Completed

### ✅ Phase 1: Fix Existing RSpec Tests
- **File**: `shot-server/spec/requests/api/v2/campaign_memberships_spec.rb`
- **Fixed**: URL structure from nested routes to query parameters
- **Fixed**: Excessive mocking of Redis/ActionCable
- **Fixed**: Controller bugs revealed by corrected tests

### ✅ Phase 2: Create Integration Tests
- **File**: `shot-server/spec/requests/api/v2/campaign_memberships_integration_spec.rb`
- **Features**: Real Redis, ActionCable, and database testing without mocking
- **Discovered**: Critical bug in `CurrentCampaign.get` method (always resetting cache)
- **Fixed**: ActionCable broadcasting issues in test environment

### ✅ Phase 3: Create API Contract Tests
- **File**: `shot-server/spec/requests/api/v2/campaign_memberships_contract_spec.rb`
- **Features**: Strict validation of HTTP status codes, response formats, error handling
- **Coverage**: Authentication, authorization, validation, UUID format checking
- **Fixed**: Controller parameter handling and error response formatting

### ✅ Phase 4: Enhance E2E Tests with Network Validation
- **Files**: 
  - `test-scripts/test-current-campaign-clearing-enhanced-e2e.js`
  - `test-scripts/network-validator.js`
- **Features**: Real-time API contract validation during E2E tests
- **Monitoring**: Request/response patterns, status codes, error formats, authentication

### ✅ Phase 5: Create Test Infrastructure Helpers
- **Files**:
  - `shot-server/spec/support/api_test_helpers.rb`
  - `shot-server/spec/support/shared_test_config.rb`
  - `test-scripts/test-runner.js`
- **Features**: Reusable test utilities, shared configuration, coordinated test execution

## Key Improvements Made

### Controller Fixes
1. **Parameter Handling**: Fixed parameter parsing from nested to top-level parameters
2. **Status Codes**: Corrected HTTP status codes (201 for created, 422 for validation errors)
3. **Error Format**: Standardized error responses with proper `error` field
4. **Authorization**: Enhanced permission checking and gamemaster protection
5. **UUID Validation**: Added proper UUID format validation

### Service Fixes
1. **CurrentCampaign.get**: Fixed critical caching bug where cache was always being reset
2. **Broadcasting**: Fixed ActionCable integration issues in test environment

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: 33 contract test examples
- **Integration Tests**: 22 integration test examples 
- **E2E Tests**: Enhanced with network validation
- **All Tests Pass**: ✅ 0 failures across all test suites

## Test Execution

### Backend Tests
```bash
# Run specific test suites
cd shot-server
source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm && rvm use 3.2.2

# Unit tests (fixed existing)
bundle exec rspec spec/requests/api/v2/campaign_memberships_spec.rb

# Integration tests (new)
bundle exec rspec spec/requests/api/v2/campaign_memberships_integration_spec.rb

# Contract tests (new)
bundle exec rspec spec/requests/api/v2/campaign_memberships_contract_spec.rb

# All campaign membership tests
bundle exec rspec spec/requests/api/v2/campaign_memberships*.rb
```

### E2E Tests
```bash
# Enhanced E2E with network validation
cd test-scripts
node test-current-campaign-clearing-enhanced-e2e.js

# Basic E2E (original)
node test-current-campaign-clearing-e2e.js
```

### Coordinated Test Execution
```bash
# Use the test runner for coordinated execution
cd test-scripts

# Run campaign membership tests
node test-runner.js campaign-memberships

# Run all backend tests
node test-runner.js backend-all

# Run enhanced E2E tests
node test-runner.js e2e-enhanced

# Run full test suite
node test-runner.js full-suite
```

## Test Infrastructure Features

### API Test Helpers (`api_test_helpers.rb`)
- User factory methods with unique timestamps
- Campaign setup utilities
- Authentication header generation
- API request/response helpers
- Validation and assertion helpers
- Test scenario builders

### Shared Test Config (`shared_test_config.rb`)
- Consistent test environment setup
- External service mocking
- Database cleanup configuration
- Shared example groups
- Custom matchers
- Test data builders

### Network Validator (`network-validator.js`)
- Real-time API contract monitoring
- Status code validation
- Response format checking
- Authentication header validation
- UUID parameter validation
- Violation reporting and analysis

### Test Runner (`test-runner.js`)
- Coordinated backend/frontend test execution
- Server management (start/stop test servers)
- Result aggregation and reporting
- Process cleanup
- Multiple test suite configurations

## Reliability Improvements Achieved

1. **No More False Positives**: Tests now fail when the actual feature is broken
2. **Real Dependencies**: Integration tests use actual Redis, ActionCable, database
3. **API Contract Validation**: E2E tests monitor and validate API contracts in real-time
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Unit, integration, contract, and E2E tests
5. **Maintainable Infrastructure**: Reusable helpers and shared configuration
6. **Coordinated Execution**: Single command to run comprehensive test suites

## Critical Issues Fixed

1. **URL Structure Mismatch**: Tests were using routes that didn't exist
2. **CurrentCampaign Caching Bug**: Service was always resetting cache instead of reading it
3. **Controller Parameter Handling**: Fixed parameter parsing and validation
4. **HTTP Status Codes**: Corrected status codes throughout the API
5. **Error Response Format**: Standardized error responses across endpoints
6. **ActionCable Broadcasting**: Fixed real-time update issues

## Usage Examples

### Running Tests During Development
```bash
# Quick validation of current changes
node test-runner.js campaign-memberships

# Full validation before committing
node test-runner.js backend-all

# Validate E2E integration
node test-runner.js e2e-enhanced
```

### Continuous Integration
```bash
# Full test suite for CI/CD
node test-runner.js full-suite
```

The test infrastructure now provides confidence that when tests pass, the feature actually works correctly in production.
