# Testing Gap Investigation Specification

**Project**: shot-client-next Jest Unit Testing Enhancement
**Date**: 2025-01-27
**Priority**: Medium

## Overview

This specification outlines a systematic investigation to identify additional testing opportunities and edge cases not currently covered in the existing Jest test suite of 344 tests. The goal is to achieve comprehensive coverage of critical application functionality and identify potential regression risks.

## Current Testing State

**Baseline**: 344 passing tests covering:
- Core services (CharacterService, VehicleService, SharedService, DiceService)
- Utility functions (parseToNumber, queryParams, filterConfigs, errorHandler, paginateArray)
- State management (formState, userState reducers)
- React hooks (useEntity)
- Components (Autocomplete, EmailChangeConfirmation, ProfilePageClient)

## Investigation Methodology

### Phase 1: Automated Code Analysis
Use the code-searcher agent to systematically examine untested areas of the codebase.

### Phase 2: Manual Edge Case Review
Review existing tests for missing boundary conditions and error scenarios.

### Phase 3: Risk Assessment
Prioritize findings based on business impact and user-facing consequences.

### Phase 4: Implementation Planning
Create actionable test scenarios with effort estimates.

## Investigation Targets

### 1. React Components (High Priority)

**Complex Components to Analyze:**
- Form components with validation logic (`src/components/*/Form.tsx`)
- Autocomplete components with async functionality (`src/components/*/Autocomplete.tsx`)
- List/table components with sorting and filtering (`src/components/*/List.tsx`, `*Table.tsx`)
- Modal and dialog components with state management
- Navigation and routing components
- Layout components with responsive behavior

**Testing Gaps to Identify:**
- Event handling edge cases
- State update race conditions
- Error boundary behavior
- Accessibility interactions
- Mobile/responsive breakpoints
- Loading state transitions

### 2. Custom React Hooks (High Priority)

**Hooks to Investigate:**
- Data fetching hooks with error handling
- State management hooks with complex logic
- Event listener hooks and cleanup
- Local storage hooks
- WebSocket connection hooks
- Custom form hooks

**Edge Cases to Find:**
- Cleanup in useEffect dependencies
- Memory leaks from unclosed subscriptions
- Race conditions in async operations
- Error handling in hook chains
- Component unmount timing issues

### 3. API Client Layer (High Priority)

**Client Modules to Test:**
- Individual client files (`src/lib/client/*Client.ts`)
- Request/response transformation
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Authentication token management
- WebSocket client functionality

**Missing Test Scenarios:**
- Network timeout handling
- Token expiration during requests
- Malformed API responses
- Rate limiting scenarios
- Concurrent request management

### 4. Context Providers (Medium Priority)

**Contexts to Analyze:**
- `AppContext.tsx` - Global state management
- `EncounterContext.tsx` - Real-time updates
- `ToastContext.tsx` - Notification system
- `LocalStorageContext.tsx` - Storage management

**Untested Scenarios:**
- Context provider mounting/unmounting
- State synchronization across multiple consumers
- Error handling in context updates
- Memory cleanup in providers

### 5. Service Layer Gaps (Medium Priority)

**Additional Services to Test:**
- Services not yet covered by existing tests
- Complex calculation methods
- Data transformation utilities
- Business rule validation
- Integration between services

### 6. Edge Cases in Existing Tests (Medium Priority)

**CharacterService Edge Cases:**
- Extreme negative wound values
- Integer overflow in calculations
- Division by zero scenarios
- Invalid character type transitions
- Concurrent state modifications

**DiceService Edge Cases:**
- Extreme explosion chains (1000+ consecutive 6s)
- Performance with very large dice pools
- Floating point precision issues
- Memory usage with massive calculations

**Utility Function Edge Cases:**
- `parseToNumber` with scientific notation, very large numbers
- `queryParams` with circular references, deeply nested objects
- `filterConfigs` with malformed configuration data
- Edge cases in array/object utilities

### 7. Error Handling Gaps (Medium Priority)

**System-Level Error Scenarios:**
- Browser storage quota exceeded
- Network connectivity loss
- JavaScript execution errors
- Memory pressure scenarios
- Browser compatibility issues

## Deliverables

### 1. Investigation Report
- **Component Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of untested components with complexity ratings
- **Hook Analysis**: Custom hooks requiring test coverage with dependency mapping
- **API Layer Gaps**: Missing test scenarios in client modules
- **Edge Case Documentation**: Specific missing test cases in existing suites
- **Risk Assessment**: Priority matrix based on business impact

### 2. Test Implementation Plan
- **High Priority Tests**: 20-30 critical test scenarios
- **Medium Priority Tests**: 15-25 important but less critical scenarios
- **Low Priority Tests**: 10-15 edge cases for comprehensive coverage
- **Effort Estimates**: Time requirements for each category
- **Mock Requirements**: Infrastructure needed for complex tests

### 3. Coverage Enhancement Roadmap
- **Phase 1**: Critical component and hook tests (2-3 weeks)
- **Phase 2**: API client and context tests (1-2 weeks)
- **Phase 3**: Edge case and error handling tests (1 week)
- **Success Metrics**: Target test count increase and coverage goals

## Implementation Process

### Step 1: Code Discovery
1. Use code-searcher agent to map untested files
2. Analyze component complexity and interaction patterns
3. Identify high-risk areas lacking coverage
4. Document findings in structured format

### Step 2: Edge Case Analysis
1. Review existing test files for missing scenarios
2. Identify boundary conditions not tested
3. Map error handling paths
4. Document specific test cases to implement

### Step 3: Risk Prioritization
1. Assess business impact of untested code
2. Consider user-facing consequences of failures
3. Evaluate regression risk for uncovered functionality
4. Create priority matrix for implementation

### Step 4: Implementation Planning
1. Group related test scenarios
2. Estimate effort for each test category
3. Define mock/fixture requirements
4. Create implementation timeline

## Success Criteria

- **Comprehensive Analysis**: All major application areas systematically reviewed
